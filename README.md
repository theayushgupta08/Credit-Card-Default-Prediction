# Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
Credit card default prediction is an important real-world machine learning problem in the finance industry. Banks and lenders want to understand the risk profile of customers to make informed lending decisions and minimize defaults.

The goal of this project is to predict credit card default using historical customer data. The inputs are features like income, age, loan amount, and loan-to-income ratio. The target is a binary variable indicating whether the customer defaulted or not.

The dataset contains historical customer data including the target default status. This supervised classification dataset can be used to train machine learning models to predict the likelihood of default based on customer attributes.

In this project, I explore the dataset, preprocess the features, split into train-test sets, train a logistic regression model, and evaluate its performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification metrics.

The results demonstrate proficiency in an end-to-end machine learning workflow and highlight capability in applying these techniques to an important business prediction problem. The skills and approach can be extended to other binary classification tasks involving tabular data.

This credit card default prediction project provides hands-on experience with a real-world industry challenge and demonstrates applied machine learning skills that can create business value.
